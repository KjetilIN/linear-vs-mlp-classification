# Linear Vs. Mlp-classification

Exploring supervised learning using gradient descent. It compares linear classifiers with multi-layer perceptron (MLP) and examines binary versus multi-class classification. A key focus is implementing and understanding the backpropagation algorithm in neural networks.
